## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Issue:** The `find_by_driving_question` tool is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of NGSS standards structure. NGSS standards do NOT contain "driving questions" as intrinsic data.

**Impact:**
- Core product capabilities redefined (5 tools → 4 tools)
- Epic 2 obsolete (14 story points)
- 27 files require updates
- 2-3 weeks cleanup effort

**Recommendation:** APPROVED
- Direct removal of non-existent feature
- MVP scope reduction (acceptable)
- Epic 2 redesign or deprecation required

**Routing:** Product Manager / Solution Architect (primary)

---

## 1. ISSUE SUMMARY

### Problem Statement

The `find_by_driving_question` tool and all related optimization work in Epic 2 is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of NGSS standards structure. **NGSS standards do NOT contain "driving questions" as intrinsic data.** Driving questions are pedagogical tools created by teachers to frame lessons, not properties of the standards themselves.

### Discovery Context

- **Triggering Story:** Story 1.2 (Pagination Support)
- **Discovered by:** Frank (Product Owner)
- **Discovery Date:** 2025-10-19
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect assumption about NGSS data model during initial planning

### Evidence

**Data Model Reality:**
- NGSS standards structure: Code, Topic, Performance Expectation (PE), SEP/DCI/CCC components, keywords, domain
- **NO "driving_question" or "question" field exists** in the actual NGSS data model
- Tool was matching against something that doesn't exist in the source data

**Codebase Impact:**
- 27 files reference this non-existent feature
- Complete tool implementation: ~124 lines of code (index.ts + database.ts)
- Full test suite built around non-existent capability
- Epic 2 (14 story points, 4 stories) entirely dedicated to optimizing this feature

---

## 2. IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Epic Impact Assessment

#### Epic 1: Token Efficiency ✅ Minor Impact
- **Story 1.1:** Complete - no changes needed (formatting works for all tools)
- **Story 1.2:** AFFECTED - Pagination scope reduces from 3 tools to 2 tools
- **Stories 1.3-1.5:** No impact
- **Overall:** Epic remains viable with minor Story 1.2 adjustment

#### Epic 2: Performance & Search ❌ CRITICAL IMPACT
- **All 4 stories obsolete** - focused on optimizing non-existent feature
- **E2-S1:** N-gram Indexing for driving questions → **OBSOLETE**
- **E2-S2:** Optimized Fuzzy Matcher for driving questions → **OBSOLETE**
- **E2-S3:** Query Complexity Routing → **PARTIALLY SALVAGEABLE** (applies to other search)
- **E2-S4:** Result Ranking → **SALVAGEABLE** (applies to other search tools)
- **Impact:** 14 story points wasted/require redirection
- **Recommendation:** Epic 2 must be completely redesigned or deprecated

#### Epic 3: Caching & Monitoring ⚠️ Minor Impact
- References find_by_driving_question in examples but not core functionality
- Metrics tool works for any tool
- **Impact:** Minor documentation updates only

### Artifact Conflicts Summary

| Artifact | Severity | Changes Required |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **PRD.md** | MAJOR | 6 changes - core product vision revision |
| **Epics.md** | MAJOR | 3 changes - Epic 2 complete rewrite |
| **Story 1.2** | MODERATE | 1 change - scope reduction (3 tools → 2 tools) |
| **src/server/index.ts** | MAJOR | Remove tool implementation (~55 lines) |
| **src/server/database.ts** | MAJOR | Remove method (~69 lines) |
| **Test files** | MODERATE | Remove test suites for non-existent tool |
| **Documentation** | EXTENSIVE | 27 files require updates or archiving |

### Technical Impact

**Architecture Changes:**
- **Tool count:** 5 MCP tools → 4 MCP tools
- **API surface:** Reduced by 20%
- **Data model:** No changes (driving questions never existed)

**Code Removal:**
- index.ts: ~55 lines (tool implementation)
- database.ts: ~69 lines (findByDrivingQuestion method)
- Tests: Multiple test suites
- **Total:** ~150-200 lines of code removal

**Performance Impact:**
- Epic 2 optimization work unnecessary for removed tool
- N-gram indexing patterns can be repurposed for search_standards
- Query routing and ranking still valuable for remaining tools

**Wasted Effort:**
- Story 1.1 (complete): Formatted responses for find_by_driving_question - minimal waste, works for all tools
- Epic 2 planning: 14 story points of planned work now obsolete
- Documentation: Extensive references to non-existent capability

---

## 3. RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Selected Path: Direct Adjustment + MVP Review

**Option 1 (Direct Adjustment):** ✅ PRIMARY
- Remove find_by_driving_question tool completely
- Update all documentation to reflect 4-tool architecture
- No rollback needed (Story 1.1 complete and valuable)

**Option 3 (MVP Review):** ✅ SECONDARY
- Reduce MVP scope from 5 tools to 4 tools
- Core value proposition intact (standards lookup remains)
- Token efficiency goals still achievable

**Why not Option 2 (Rollback)?**
- Story 1.1 complete and valuable for remaining 4 tools
- No benefit to reverting work that applies universally

### Rationale

1. **No rollback needed** - Story 1.1 formatting works for all tools
2. **Direct removal cleanest** - Feature never worked correctly, built on false assumptions
3. **MVP still achievable** - 4 tools sufficient for TeachFlow agents
4. **Salvage Epic 2 learnings** - N-gram/fuzzy matching concepts apply to search_standards optimization

### Effort and Risk Assessment

**Effort Estimate:** **HIGH** (16-20 hours)
- Phase 1: Documentation cleanup - 2-3 days
- Phase 2: Code removal - 1 day
- Phase 3: Epic 2 redesign - 1 week (PM/Architect)
- Phase 4: Story 1.2 rescope - 0.5 days

**Risk Assessment:** **LOW-MEDIUM**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Epic 2 work wasted (14 pts) | HIGH | Repurpose N-gram patterns for search_standards |
| Timeline delay | MEDIUM | Reduce scope, focus on proven value |
| Team morale | LOW | Frame as learning, early catch prevented waste |
| Breaking changes | NONE | Tool never in production, no consumers |

**Timeline Impact:**
- Immediate: 2-3 days for cleanup
- Epic 2: Defer or redesign (1-2 weeks)
- Overall: Reduces project scope by 10-15%

3. Uses 7,500 tokens to process response
4. Extracts relevant standards codes for alignment

**Optimized Experience:**
1. Agent queries with `detail_level: "summary"`
2. Receives 10 summary objects (2.5KB total)
3. Uses 750 tokens to process response **(90% reduction)**
4. Optionally fetches full details for 2-3 most relevant standards
5. **Total token usage: ~1,200 tokens (84% reduction)**

NEW:
**Current Experience:**
1. Agent queries `search_standards("energy transfer ecosystems")`
2. Receives 10 full standard objects (25KB total)
3. Uses 7,500 tokens to process response
4. Extracts relevant standards codes for alignment

**Optimized Experience:**
1. Agent queries with `detail_level: "summary"`

```

**Rationale:** Replace find_by_driving_question with search_standards tool in user journey.

#### Change #5: User Journey 2 - REMOVE ENTIRELY

**Location:** Lines 133-150

```diff
OLD:
### Journey 2: Student Question Matcher
[Entire journey focused on fuzzy driving question matching]

NEW:
[DELETE ENTIRE SECTION]
```

**Rationale:** This entire user journey depends on the non-existent find_by_driving_question tool. Remove completely.

#### Change #6: Epic 2 - Redefine scope

**Location:** Lines 197-221

```diff
OLD:
### Epic 2: Performance & Search Quality (4 stories, 14 pts)

**Goal:** 10-50x faster fuzzy matching and improved search relevance.

**Stories:**
1. **E2-S1: N-gram Indexing** (5 pts)
2. **E2-S2: Optimized Fuzzy Matcher** (5 pts)
3. **E2-S3: Query Complexity Routing** (2 pts)
4. **E2-S4: Result Ranking** (2 pts)

NEW:
### Epic 2: Search Optimization & Quality (2 stories, 4 pts) [REVISED SCOPE]

**Goal:** Improved search relevance and performance for search_standards tool.

**Stories:**
1. **E2-S1: Query Complexity Routing** (2 pts) - Route queries to optimal execution paths
2. **E2-S2: Result Ranking** (2 pts) - Multi-factor relevance scoring for search results

**Deferred:** N-gram indexing and fuzzy matching (originally E2-S1, E2-S2) - not needed without driving question tool.
```

**Rationale:** Salvage applicable stories (routing, ranking), remove fuzzy matching work built for non-existent feature.

```

#### Change #9: Epic 2 - Complete Rewrite

**Location:** Lines 152-250

```markdown
NEW CONTENT:

## Epic 2: Search Optimization & Quality [REVISED SCOPE]

**Epic Goal:** Improve search quality and query routing for search_standards and search_by_domain tools.

**Business Value:** Better search relevance and optimized query execution for remaining search tools.

**Technical Approach:** Apply query routing patterns and multi-factor ranking to existing search capabilities.

**Epic Scope Change:** Original Epic 2 (4 stories, 14 pts) focused on optimizing find_by_driving_question tool which was based on incorrect NGSS data model understanding. Revised Epic 2 (2 stories, 4 pts) salvages applicable patterns for remaining search tools.

### E2-S1: Query Complexity Routing (2 pts) [REVISED]

**User Story:** As a system, I want to route queries to optimal execution paths so that simple queries stay fast and complex queries get necessary processing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. [ ] Add query complexity scoring (simple/medium/complex)
2. [ ] Simple: exact code/keyword lookup → fast path
3. [ ] Medium: single-term search → index lookup
4. [ ] Complex: multi-term search → full-text search
5. [ ] Automatic routing based on query characteristics
6. [ ] Validation: Simple queries <5ms, complex queries <50ms

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/server/database.ts` - Add routing logic to search methods
- `src/server/query-router.ts` (new) - Complexity scoring

### E2-S2: Result Ranking (2 pts) [REVISED]

**User Story:** As a TeachFlow agent, I want results ranked by relevance so that I can quickly identify the best standard match.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. [ ] Multi-factor scoring: keyword overlap + domain relevance + text similarity
2. [ ] Weighted scoring formula tuned for NGSS standards
3. [ ] Include match confidence score in all search results
4. [ ] Sort by relevance score (highest first)
5. [ ] Validation: Manual review of 20 queries shows improved ordering

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/server/database.ts` - Update scoring in search methods
- `src/server/relevance-scorer.ts` (new) - Multi-factor ranking

### Removed Stories

**~~E2-S1: N-gram Indexing~~ (5 pts) - DEPRECATED**
- Reason: Built for find_by_driving_question tool which doesn't exist
- N-gram patterns may be repurposed for search_standards in future

**~~E2-S2: Optimized Fuzzy Matcher~~ (5 pts) - DEPRECATED**
- Reason: Levenshtein fuzzy matching built for non-existent driving questions
- Fuzzy matching concept may apply to search_standards keyword matching

**Epic 2 Impact Summary:**
- Original: 4 stories, 14 points
- Revised: 2 stories, 4 points
- Net reduction: 10 story points (71% reduction)
```

---
**DEPRECATED - 2025-10-19**

This document describes the `find_by_driving_question` tool which was removed from the project.

**Reason:** The tool was based on an incorrect assumption that NGSS standards contain "driving questions" as intrinsic data. NGSS standards do NOT include driving questions - these are pedagogical tools created by teachers, not properties of the standards.

**Status:** Tool removed, all references cleaned up across codebase and documentation.

**Reference:** See docs/sprint-change-proposal-remove-driving-questions.md for complete change analysis.
