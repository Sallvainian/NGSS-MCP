- [x] 2-Plan (Optimization PRD & Epics complete)
- [ ] 3-Solutioning (Not required for Level 2)
- [ ] 4-Implementation (Story 1.1 ready for development)

## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

**Story Queue Status:**
- **BACKLOG:** 9 stories (27 points remaining)
- **TODO:** E1-S3 - Smart Field Selection (3 points - needs drafting)
- **IN PROGRESS:** E1-S2 - Pagination Support (3 points - Ready for development)
- **DONE:** 1 story (5 points completed)

**Completed Stories:**

| Story ID | Title | File | Completed Date | Points |
|----------|-------|------|----------------|--------|
| 1.1 | Response Detail Levels | story-1.1.md | 2025-10-19 | 5 |

**Total completed:** 1 story
**Total points completed:** 5 points

**Current Epic:** Epic 1 - Token Efficiency & Response Optimization (5 stories, 16 points)

**Completion:** 13% (5/38 points)

## Project Context

**Goal:** Optimize existing NGSS MCP server for performance and token efficiency
**Value Proposition:** 95% token reduction (2-3KB → 300-500 bytes per lookup)
**Technology Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, fast-levenshtein

**Current State:** All 5 MCP tools fully implemented and working ✅
1. ✅ get_standard(code) - Complete standard by code
2. ✅ search_by_domain(domain, grade_level) - Browse by domain
3. ✅ find_by_driving_question(question) - Fuzzy matching (needs optimization)
4. ✅ get_3d_components(code) - Lightweight 3D lookup
5. ✅ search_standards(query, filters) - Full-text search

**Optimization Goals:**
- Token efficiency: 95% reduction through configurable responses
- Performance: 10-50x faster fuzzy matching via N-gram indexing
- Caching: 70%+ cache hit rate with intelligent strategy
- Monitoring: Performance metrics visibility via MCP tool

## Planning Artifacts

- ✅ PRD.md - Optimization Product Requirements Document
- ✅ Epics.md - Epic and Story Breakdown (3 epics, 12 stories, 38 points)
- ✅ Existing codebase analyzed (all 5 tools working)
- ✅ Data extracted: 106KB JSON file with MS standards

## Next Action

**What to do next:** Implement Story 1.2 (Pagination Support)
**Command to run:** Load DEV agent and run `dev-story` workflow
**Agent to load:** DEV (bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md)

**Planning Complete:**
- Epic 1: Token Efficiency (5 stories, 16 pts)
- Epic 2: Performance (4 stories, 14 pts)
- Epic 3: Caching (3 stories, 8 pts)

**Prerequisites Met:**
- ✅ Working MCP server with all 5 tools
- ✅ 106KB extracted data file
- ✅ Optimization priorities identified
- ✅ Benchmark baseline available

## Planned Workflow Journey

### Phase 2: Planning ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] plan-project - Generated PRD, Epics, Tech-Spec
- [x] Level determined: Level 2 (17 stories, 4 epics)

### Phase 3: Solutioning
- Skipped (Not required for Level 2 projects)

### Phase 4: Implementation (Current)
- [x] create-story - Draft E1-S1 story file
- [x] story-ready - Approve story for development
- [x] story-context - Generate context XML
- [x] dev-story - Implement E1-S1
- [x] story-approved - Mark E1-S1 complete
- [x] create-story - Draft E1-S2 story file
- [x] story-context - Generate E1-S2 context XML
- [x] story-ready - Approve E1-S2 for development
- [ ] dev-story - Implement E1-S2 ← **YOU ARE HERE**
- [ ] (Repeat for remaining 11 stories)
