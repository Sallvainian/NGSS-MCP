# Product Requirements Document: NGSS MCP Server

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Project Level:** 2 (12-40 stories, 2-5 epics)
**Status:** Planning
**Owner:** PM

---

## Executive Summary

Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides token-efficient access to Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) data for the TeachFlow education module. The server will reduce token consumption by 95% (from 7,500 to 350 tokens per lookup) by providing targeted data retrieval through 5 specialized tools instead of requiring agents to load entire JSON files.

**Core Value Proposition:** Enable TeachFlow AI agents to access NGSS standards data efficiently without wasting tokens on irrelevant information, while maintaining complete 3D Learning Framework integrity (Science & Engineering Practices, Disciplinary Core Ideas, Crosscutting Concepts).

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenge

TeachFlow education module agents need frequent access to NGSS standards data to:
- Align lesson plans with educational standards
- Provide 3D learning scope for student tutoring
- Validate instructional design against standards framework

**Without MCP Server:**
- Agents must load entire NGSS JSON files (hundreds of standards)
- Each lookup costs 5K-10K tokens
- Repeated lookups across agent conversations waste significant tokens
- No intelligent search capabilities (exact code matching only)

**Token Impact Example:**
- Student asks: "What's my lesson's driving question?"
- Agent needs to find matching standard
- Current approach: Load entire MS Life Science JSON (7,500 tokens)
- Get one standard back (350 tokens of actual data)
- **Waste: 7,150 tokens (95% inefficiency)**

### User Impact

**Primary Users:** TeachFlow AI Agents
1. **Standards Aligner Agent** - Needs fast 3D component lookups
2. **Instructional Designer Agent** - Requires domain browsing and standard details
3. **Alpha (Student Support)** - Must match student's driving question to standard

**User Pain Points:**
- Slow response times due to token processing overhead
- Limited conversation history due to context window consumption
- Cannot perform fuzzy matching (students rarely remember exact driving question phrasing)
- No keyword-based discovery for lesson planning

---

## User Personas

### Persona 1: Standards Aligner Agent (Critical Infrastructure)

**Role:** 3D Learning Intelligence Hub
**Needs:** Fast, accurate access to complete 3D breakdown of any standard
**Primary Tools:** get_standard(), get_3d_components(), find_by_driving_question()

**User Journey:**
1. Instructional Designer requests lesson plan for "MS-LS1-6"
2. Standards Aligner calls get_standard("MS-LS1-6")
3. Receives complete SEP/DCI/CCC breakdown in <1 second
4. Provides 3D framework to Instructional Designer
5. **Success:** Designer has scope boundaries for lesson planning

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- No more loading entire domain files
- Instant access to 3D components
- Clear scope boundaries (depth_boundaries field)

### Persona 2: Alpha - Student Support Agent

**Role:** One-on-one student tutoring within lesson scope
**Needs:** Match student's rough driving question to exact standard
**Primary Tools:** find_by_driving_question()

**User Journey:**
1. Student says: "I think it's about how plants get their food or something"
2. Alpha calls find_by_driving_question("how plants get food")
3. Fuzzy matching returns MS-LS1-6 (photosynthesis)
4. Alpha retrieves 3D scope and teaches within boundaries
5. **Success:** Student gets on-topic help without going beyond lesson scope

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Fuzzy matching handles imprecise student memory
- No manual searching through standards lists
- Instant scope establishment for tutoring session

### Persona 3: Instructional Designer Agent

**Role:** Lesson plan creation and curriculum design
**Needs:** Browse available standards by domain, search by keywords
**Primary Tools:** search_by_domain(), search_standards()

**User Journey:**
1. Designer wants to create unit on "Energy in ecosystems"
2. Calls search_standards("energy ecosystem", {domain: "Life Science"})
3. Gets list of relevant MS Life Science standards
4. Explores each with get_standard() for full details
5. Delegates to Standards Aligner for 3D framework integration
6. **Success:** Complete unit plan aligned to multiple standards

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Keyword-based discovery (not just code lookup)
- Domain filtering for relevant browsing
- Progressive disclosure (list â†’ details)
