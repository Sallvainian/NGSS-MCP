# TeachFlow Session - Documentation Cleanup & Sync

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Session Type:** Documentation synchronization and cleanup
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Session Summary

Completed cleanup and synchronization of TeachFlow module documentation following the comprehensive module brief creation session (2025-10-14).

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Broken Agent File
**Problem**: `instructional-designer.agent.yaml` referenced 4 non-existent workflows, causing agent to fail on load.

**Solution**: Deleted the improperly created agent file entirely.
- Agent was created prematurely (before proper BMAD workflow sequence)
- All specifications preserved in module brief for proper recreation later
- Follows correct BMAD sequence: module-brief → create-module → create-agent

**Rationale**: Proper BMAD workflow is module-brief first, then agents created via create-agent workflow. The premature agent violated this sequence.

### 2. Updated config.yaml
**File**: `/bmad/teachflow/config.yaml`

**Changes**:
- Agent count: 8 → 11 (5 core + 6 supporting)
- Added new agents:
  - `alpha` - Student Support Agent (Core #5)
  - `standards-aligner` - Critical Infrastructure Agent
  - `qa-validation` - Quality gatekeeper
- Renamed: `report-generator` → `artifact-generator`
- Updated workflows: Removed `unit-planning`, added `student-support-session`
- Updated delegation rules with comments explaining critical delegations:
  - Standards Aligner marked as "CRITICAL FIRST DELEGATION" for Instructional Designer and Alpha
  - QA/Validation added to all core agents for quality gates

### 3. Completely Rewrote TODO.md
**File**: `/bmad/teachflow/TODO.md`

**Major Updates**:
- Added **Phase 0: NGSS MCP Server** (separate project, 12-18 hours)
  - Located at `/dev/personal/ngss-mcp-server/` (greenfield)
  - 5 tools: get_standard, search_by_domain, find_by_driving_question, get_3d_components, search_standards
  - Token efficiency rationale: 95% reduction vs JSON approach
  
- Reorganized all phases (0-5) to match module brief architecture
- Updated agent specifications with 3D Learning integration
- Added comprehensive design decision rationale
- Included user context (Frank, middle school science teacher)
- Updated progress tracking: 11 agents, 9 workflows, 54-70 hours estimate

**Key Sections Added**:
- Overview with viability score (9/10) and confidence (85%)
- Phase 0 details (NGSS MCP Server as foundation)
- 3D Learning Framework explanation (SEP, DCI, CCC)
- NGSS MCP Server tool specifications
- User context and teaching environment
- Design decision rationale for all major choices

## Current TeachFlow State

**Documentation**:
- ✅ Module brief: `/docs/module-brief-teachflow-2025-10-14.md` (1,294 lines, comprehensive)
- ✅ config.yaml: Synced with 11-agent architecture
- ✅ TODO.md: Synced with Phase 0-5 roadmap
- ✅ README.md: Existing (90/100 quality)

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **0 agents** (correct - none should exist before create-agent workflow)
- ✅ **0 workflows** (correct - none should exist before create-workflow)
- ✅ Clean state ready for proper BMAD workflow sequence

**Next Phase**: Phase 0 (NGSS MCP Server) - in progress in separate project

## Key Decisions

### 1. Deleted Premature Agent
Removed `instructional-designer.agent.yaml` because:
- Violated proper BMAD workflow sequence
- Should use create-agent workflow with module brief as input
- All specifications preserved in comprehensive module brief
- Clean slate approach for proper implementation

### 2. NGSS MCP Server as Phase 0
Confirmed separate project approach:
- Greenfield project at `/dev/personal/ngss-mcp-server/`
- Professional microservice architecture
- 95% token efficiency vs JSON file approach
- Reusable across education projects

### 3. Documentation Sync Priority
Updated config.yaml and TODO.md before implementation:
- Ensures all documentation reflects final architecture
- Module brief is authoritative source
- Prevents drift between planning and implementation

## Architecture Insights

**Standards Aligner as Keystone**:
- Both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend on it
- Must be Phase 1 (after NGSS MCP Server in Phase 0)
- Simple agent design (delegates to MCP server)

**3D Learning Integration**:
- Not an add-on - core architecture
- All lesson planning flows through 3D framework (SEP, DCI, CCC)
- Differentiates TeachFlow from generic lesson planners

**QA/Validation Early**:
- Phase 2 (not deferred)
- Establishes quality gates before complex agents
- Critical for Alpha safety in Phase 4

## File Changes

**Modified**:
- `/bmad/teachflow/config.yaml` - Updated agent count, names, delegation rules
- `/bmad/teachflow/TODO.md` - Complete rewrite with Phase 0-5 structure

**Deleted**:
- `/bmad/teachflow/agents/instructional-designer.agent.yaml` - Premature creation

**Unchanged**:
- `/bmad/teachflow/README.md` - Still accurate (90/100 quality)
- `/docs/module-brief-teachflow-2025-10-14.md` - Complete and authoritative

## Progress Tracking

**Phase 0**: ⏳ In progress (NGSS MCP Server - separate project)
**Phase 1**: ⏳ 0/1 agents (Standards Aligner)
**Phase 2**: ⏳ 0/4 agents + 0/3 workflows + 0/1 QA agent
**Phase 3**: ⏳ 0/4 supporting agents
**Phase 4**: ⏳ 0/1 agent (Alpha) + 0/1 workflow
**Phase 5**: ⏳ 0/5 workflows + polish

**Overall**: 0% implementation (0/11 agents, 0/9 workflows)
**Planning**: 100% complete (comprehensive module brief + synced docs)

## Session Value

**High Value - Documentation Foundation Complete**:
- All planning documents synced with final architecture
- Clean implementation state (no premature artifacts)
- Ready for proper BMAD workflow sequence
- NGSS MCP Server approach validated and documented

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete Phase 0**: Finish NGSS MCP Server in separate project
2. **Begin Phase 1**: Create Standards Aligner agent (depends on MCP server)
3. **Start Phase 2**: Build core teaching agents and workflows
